\description{
In order to simplify handling or tabular ICU data, \code{ricu} provides
S3 classes, \code{id_tbl}, \code{ts_tbl}, and \code{win_tbl}. These classes essentially
consist of a \code{data.table} object, alongside some meta data and S3 dispatch
is used to enable more natural behavior for some data manipulation tasks.
For example, when merging two tables, a default for the \code{by} argument can
be chosen more sensibly if columns representing patient ID and timestamp
information can be identified.
}
\details{
The introduced classes are designed for several often encountered data
scenarios:
\itemize{
\item \code{id_tbl} objects can be used to represent static (with respect to
relevant time scales) patient data such as patient age and such an object
is simply a \code{data.table} combined with a non-zero length character vector
valued attribute marking the columns tracking patient ID information
(\code{\link[=id_vars]{id_vars}}). All further columns are considered as
\link[=data_vars]{data_vars}.
\item \code{ts_tbl} objects are used for grouped time series data. A \code{data.table}
object again is augmented by attributes, including a non-zero length
character vector identifying patient ID columns (\link[=id_vars]{id_vars}),
a string, tracking the column holding time-stamps
(\link[=index_var]{index_var}) and a scalar \code{difftime} object determining
the time-series step size \link[=interval]{interval}. Again, all further
columns are treated as \link[=data_vars]{data_vars}.
\item \code{win_tbl}: In addition to representing grouped time-series data as does
a \code{ts_tbl}, \code{win_tbl} objects also encode a validity interval for each
time-stamped measurement (as \link[=dur_var]{dur_var}). This can for example
be useful when a drug is administered at a certain infusion rate for a
given time period.
}

Owing to the nested structure of required meta data, \code{ts_tbl} inherits from
\code{id_tbl} and \code{win_tbl} from \code{ts_tbl}. Furthermore, both classes inherit from
\code{data.table}. As such, \code{data.table} \link[data.table:assign]{reference semantics}
are available for some operations, indicated by presence of a \code{by_ref}
argument. At default, value, \code{by_ref} is set to \code{FALSE} as this is in line
with base R behavior at the cost of potentially incurring unnecessary data
copies. Some care has to be taken when passing \code{by_ref = TRUE} and enabling
by reference operations as this can have side effects (see examples).

For instantiating \code{ts_tbl} objects, both \code{index_var} and \code{interval} can be
automatically determined if not specified. For the index column, the only
requirement is that a single \code{\link[base:difftime]{difftime}} column is
present, while for the time step, the minimal difference between two
consecutive observations is chosen (and all differences are therefore
required to be multiples of the minimum difference). Similarly, for a
\code{win_tbl}, exactly two \code{\link[base:difftime]{difftime}} columns are required
where the first is assumed to be corresponding to the \code{index_var} and the
second to the \code{dur_var}.

Upon instantiation, the data might be rearranged: columns are reordered
such that ID columns are moved to the front, followed by the index column
and a \code{\link[data.table:setkey]{data.table::key()}} is set on meta columns, causing rows to be sorted
accordingly. Moving meta columns to the front is done for reasons of
convenience for printing, while setting a key on meta columns is done to
improve efficiency of subsequent transformations such as merging or grouped
operations. Furthermore, \code{NA} values in either ID or index columns are not
allowed and therefore corresponding rows are silently removed.

Coercion between \code{id_tbl} and \code{ts_tbl} (and \code{win_tbl}) by default keeps
intersecting attributes fixed and new attributes are by default inferred as
for class instantiation. Each class comes with a class-specific
implementation of the S3 generic function \code{validate_tbl()} which returns
\code{TRUE} if the object is considered valid or a string outlining the type of
validation failure that was encountered. Validity requires
\enumerate{
\item inheriting from \code{data.table} and unique column names
\item for \code{id_tbl} that all columns specified by the non-zero length character
vector holding onto the \code{id_vars} specification are available
\item for \code{ts_tbl} that the string-valued \code{index_var} column is available and
does not intersect with \code{id_vars} and that the index column obeys the
specified interval.
\item for \code{win_tbl} that the string-valued \code{dur_var} corresponds to a
\code{difftime} vector and is not among the columns marked as index or ID
variables
}

Finally, inheritance can be checked by calling \code{is_id_tbl()} and
\code{is_ts_tbl()}. Note that due to \code{ts_tbl} inheriting from \code{id_tbl},
\code{is_id_tbl()} returns \code{TRUE} for both \code{id_tbl} and \code{ts_tbl} objects (and
similarly for \code{win_tbl}), while \code{is_ts_tbl()} only returns \code{TRUE} for
\code{ts_tbl} objects.
}
\section{Relationship to \code{data.table}}{

Both \code{id_tbl} and \code{ts_tbl} inherit from \code{data.table} and as such, functions
intended for use with \code{data.table} objects can be applied to \code{id_tbl} and
\code{ts_tbl} as well. But there are some caveats: Many functions introduced by
\code{data.table} are not S3 generic and therefore they would have to be masked
in order to retain control over how they operate on objects inheriting form
\code{data.table}. Take for example the function \code{\link[data.table:setattr]{data.table::setnames()}}, which
changes column names by reference. Using this function, the name of an
index column of an \code{id_tbl} object can me changed without updating the
attribute marking the column as such and thusly leaving the object in an
inconsistent state. Instead of masking the function \code{setnames()}, an
alternative is provided as \code{\link[=rename_cols]{rename_cols()}}. In places where it is possible
to seamlessly insert the appropriate function (such as
\code{\link[base:names]{base::names<-()}} or \code{\link[base:colnames]{base::colnames<-()}}) and the responsibility for not
using \code{\link[data.table:setattr]{data.table::setnames()}} in a way that breaks the \code{id_tbl} object is
left to the user.

Owing to \code{data.table} heritage, one of the functions that is often called
on \code{id_tbl} and \code{ts_tbl} objects is base S3 generic [base::\code{[}()]. As this
function is capable of modifying the object in a way that makes it
incompatible with attached meta data, an attempt is made at preserving as
much as possible and if all fails, a \code{data.table} object is returned
instead of an object inheriting form \code{id_tbl}. If for example the index
column is removed (or modified in a way that makes it incompatible with the
interval specification) from a \code{ts_tbl}, an \code{id_tbl} is returned. If
however the ID column is removed the only sensible thing to return is a
\code{data.table} (see examples).
