\description{
ICU datasets such as MIMIC-III or eICU typically represent patients by
multiple ID systems such as patient IDs, hospital stay IDs and ICU
admission IDs. Even if the raw data is available in only one such ID
system, given a mapping of IDs alongside start and end times, it is
possible to convert data from one ID system to another. The function
\code{change_id()} provides such a conversion utility, internally either
calling \code{upgrade_id()} when moving to an ID system with higher cardinality
and \code{downgrade_id()} when the target ID system is of lower cardinality
}
\details{
In order to provide ID system conversion for a data source, the (internal)
function \code{\link[=id_map]{id_map()}} must be able to construct an ID mapping for that data
source. Constructing such a mapping can be expensive w.r.t. the frequency
it might be re-used and therefore, \code{\link[=id_map]{id_map()}} provides caching
infrastructure. The mapping itself is constructed by the (internal)
function \code{\link[=id_map_helper]{id_map_helper()}}, which is expected to provide source and
destination ID columns as well as start and end columns corresponding to
the destination ID, relative to the source ID system. In the following
example, we request for \code{mimic_demo}, with ICU stay IDs as source and
hospital admissions as destination IDs.

Both start and end columns encode the hospital admission windows relative
to each corresponding ICU stay start time. It therefore comes as no
surprise that most start times are negative (hospital admission typically
occurs before ICU stay start time), while end times are often days in the
future (as hospital discharge typically occurs several days after ICU
admission).

In order to use the ID conversion infrastructure offered by \code{ricu} for a
new dataset, it typically suffices to provide an \code{id_cfg} entry in the
source configuration (see \code{\link[=load_src_cfg]{load_src_cfg()}}), outlining the available ID
systems alongside an ordering, as well as potentially a class specific
implementation of \code{\link[=id_map_helper]{id_map_helper()}} for the given source class, specifying
the corresponding time windows in 1 minute resolution (for every possible
pair of IDs).

While both up- and downgrades for \code{id_tbl} objects, as well as downgrades
for \code{ts_tbl} objects are simple merge operations based on the ID mapping
provided by \code{\link[=id_map]{id_map()}}, ID upgrades for \code{ts_tbl} objects are slightly more
involved. As an example, consider the following setting: we have \code{data}
associated with \code{hadm_id} IDs and times relative to hospital admission:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{               1      2       3        4       5       6        7      8

                                         HADM_1
            0h     7h                26h        37h             53h      62h
hadm_id     |-------------------------------------------------------------|
icustay_id         |------------------|          |---------------|
                   0h                19h         0h             16h
                           ICU_1                       ICU_2
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

The mapping of data points from \code{hadm_id} to \code{icustay_id} is created as
follows: ICU stay end times mark boundaries and all data that is recorded
after the last ICU stay ended is assigned to the last ICU stay. Therefore
data points 1-3 are assigned to \code{ICU_1}, while 4-8 are assigned to \code{ICU_2}.
Times have to be shifted as well, as timestamps are expected to be relative
to the current ID system. Data points 1-3 therefore are assigned to time
stamps -4h, 3h and 11h, while data points 4-8 are assigned to -10h, -2h,
6h, 15h and 22h. Implementation-wise, the mapping is computed using an
efficient \code{data.table} rolling join.
