\description{
The sepsis 3 label consists of a suspected infection combined with an acute
increase in SOFA score.
}
\details{
The Sepsis-3 Consensus (Singer et. al.) defines sepsis as an acute
increase in the SOFA score (see \code{\link[=sofa_score]{sofa_score()}}) of 2 points or more within
the suspected infection (SI) window (see \code{\link[=susp_inf]{susp_inf()}}):
\figure{sofa-sep-3-1.png}

A patient can potentially have multiple SI windows. The argument
\code{si_window} is used to control which SI window we focus on (options are
\verb{"first", "last", "any"}).

Further, although a 2 or more point increase in the SOFA score is defined,
it is not perfectly clear to which value the increase refers. For this the
\code{delta_fun} argument is used. If the increase is required to happen with
respect to the minimal SOFA value (within the SI window) up to the current
time, the \code{delta_cummin} function should be used. If, however, we are
looking for an increase with respect to the start of the SI window, then
the \code{delta_start} function should be used. Lastly, the increase might be
defined with respect to values of the previous 24 hours, in which case the
\code{delta_min} function is used.
