Package: ricu
Title: Intensive Care Unit Data with R
Description: Focused on (but not exclusive to) data sets hosted on PhysioNet,
    'ricu' provides utilities for download, setup and access of intensive care
    unit (ICU) data sets. In addition to functions for running arbitrary
    queries against available data sets, a system for defining clinical
    concepts and encoding their representations in tabular ICU data is
    presented.
